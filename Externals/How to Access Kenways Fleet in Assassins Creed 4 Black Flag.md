## How to Play Kenway's Fleet
 
Kenway's Fleet is a fun and rewarding way to use your naval skills and resources to expand your influence and wealth. Here are some tips on how to play Kenway's Fleet and get the most out of it.
 
### How to Add Ships
 
To add ships to Kenway's Fleet, you need to board and capture enemy ships in naval combat and choose the Send to Kenway's Fleet option. You can have up to 15 ships in your fleet, but you may need to purchase docks for additional ships with gemstones. You can also salvage old ships for gemstones if you want to replace them with better ones. The ships you add to your fleet cannot be leveled up, but their statistics are determined by their type and where they were found. There are four types of ships: Gunboat, Schooner, Brig, and Man O' War. The higher the level of the ship, the more cargo space, speed, power, and defense it has. The level of the ship also depends on where it was found: Gulf of Mexico (level 1), Southern British Colonies (level 2), Eastern British Colonies (level 3), Eastern Canada (level 4), Northwest Europe (level 5), Bay of Biscay (level 6), Portugal (level 7), Mediterranean Sea (level 8), North Africa (level 9), Cape Verde (level 10), South Africa (level 11), and South Atlantic (level 12). Note that your fleet's sails will grow darker as you complete more missions, eventually becoming completely black.
 
### How to Battle and Gain Resources
 
To carry out missions, you need resources (cargo) such as sugar, rum, wood, metal, cloth, and fire barrels. You can gain resources by battling other ships on routes. This also reduces a route's danger level, making successful missions more likely. To battle, choose an area and then choose BATTLE. You can then choose up to three ships you wish to use to do battle. You will then watch the battle and, if you win, you will get the resources needed to perform missions. During battle, you can also launch fire barrels to deal extra damage to enemy ships, although you only have a finite supply (more are gained from additional battles). The ships you use for battle will get bonuses depending on their position: the top ship gains a speed bonus, the middle ship gains a power bonus, and the bottom ship gains a defense bonus. Enemy ships don't seem to benefit from these bonuses. Shipping routes progress in danger over time from safe (green), hazardous (yellow), dangerous (orange), to treacherous (red). The more dangerous the route, the more powerful the ships you will face in battle.
 
### How to Complete Missions
 
To complete missions, you need to have enough resources and send one ship per mission. Some missions will be impossible to complete without the largest ship, the Man O' War, because it is the only ship with sufficient cargo space. You can only send ships on missions that have the minimum amount of cargo/resources required by the mission. Faster ships will complete missions more quickly than slower ones. Missions will continue in real time even if you are not playing, allowing for some missions to take well over 24 real world hours to complete. Playing with other friends online in the game will speed up the missions. Missions will reward you with Reales, cosmetic upgrades for the Jackdaw, buried chests maps with upgrade plans, hideout items, and a new outfit for Edward [^1^]. There are nearly 90 fleet missions available when you unlock all 25 fleet locations [^1^].
